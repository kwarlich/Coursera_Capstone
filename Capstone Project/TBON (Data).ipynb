Once the maps are complete, I would then use the foursquare location data for the location of the venues inside of the cities. I would make them into a Pandas dataframes. Each of the dataframe would allow me to manipulate the information so i would be able to narrow down the type of venues that necessarily important to answer the question. when i would be able to see if there is another comic book store in the area. Once I am able to see if there is a comic book store within the area I would be able to answer his question. Which city would be best for his store."
